		<center><p2 style="color:white">Hello and welcome to Pineapple Hunt. In this first screen you will see our Branding Screen consisting of a Pentagram and our Names in native african tribe font. Next we get to the main screen, which has a begin button and a credits button. We are going to click the begin button and begin the game immediately. The game begins and your goal is to click pineapple to kill them. Every 3 seconds the score goes down by 2. Every tap gives you 4 points and a satisfying gunshot sound. At the top you can quit the game or go directly to the credits. We are going to win the game really quick.Wow we just won! We get a notifier telling us this and now we get to go to the credits by clicking this here. Haha just kidding you go to shaq screen and here you can click the button no to get to the main screen. Now we see the main screen again. Let’s click credits. Oops clicked begin game. Now we can show you the quit game feature. You can click yes or no and quit the game back to the main screen. Now let’s go into the credits and we can see it was designed by Qayz Nurani and Jesse Gordon. Thanks for watching!

		<center><p2 style="color:white">Over the past week and a half my partner, Jesse Gordon, and I have been working on an android project called Pineapple Hunt. Pineapple Hunt was originally going to be a duck hunt type game but we realised we would have a difficult time making the game work within the original timeframe of one week. The original difficulty we faced was having to get the UI setup. The problem was that the UI would not place on the screen without being cut off by the top. We solved this problem by making the canvas for the game smaller so that the buttons could fit. However, when we did this, the canvas was too small to display the whole game, making the game too wide for the canvas. This was easily solved with a few changes in the pixel size. The next big challenge we faced was the scoring. Originally, the score went up forever by 6 points every time, however we realised that the game wouldn’t be fun as an infinite score game. Instead we took the opportunity to make a race against the clock type game in order to create a winning event.<br>

        <br>
        One part I did independently was most of the actual game coding. Jesse worked more on the contact and title page. The actual game coding consisted of making the pineapples “disappear” if you are too slow, and they have to clear the canvas every 3 seconds in order to write the score. A problem with this was figuring out what we wanted the pineapples to do. Originally it was supposed to be a duck-hunt like game with the pineapples moving across, however we had to change to a more simple disappearing effect in order to finish the project on time.
